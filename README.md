# PythonIBM

Practice examples after the 3 full days training:
1) Python Program to Check Whether a String is Palindrome or Not. A palindrome is a string that is the same read forward or backward. E.g. Mom
2) Python Program to Remove Punctuations From a given String
3) Write a Python class named Circle constructed by a radius and two methods which will compute the area and the perimeter of a circle.
4) Python Program to Sort Words in Alphabetic Order
5) Python Program to Count the Number of Each Vowel
6) Python Program to Find LCM. The least common multiple (L.C.M.) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is perfectly divisible by the two given numbers. For example, the L.C.M. of 12 and 14 is 84.
7) Python Program to Check Armstrong Number. In case of an Armstrong number of 3 digits, the sum of cubes of each digit is equal to the number itself. For example: 153 = 1*1*1 + 5*5*5 + 3*3*3  // 153 is an Armstrong number.
8) Python Program to Find the Factorial of a Number
9) Python Program to Solve Quadratic Equation. The standard form of a quadratic equation is: ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b and c are real numbers and a â‰  0

Try these examples in usual way and then using Pythonic way (i.e. try reduce number of lines and use Python's differenting features).
